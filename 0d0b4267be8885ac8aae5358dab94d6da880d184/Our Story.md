Our Story
Far far away, in a small student town called Wageningen. There once lived two people who were drawn to each other...

An Innocent Lunch
Feb 2015
In a lunch room at Wageningen University Mieke and Mario met for the first time. An innocent talk, and without any luck, they might have passed each other. What a luck, that luck exists üòâ.

5:00 In the Morning
7th March 2015
While the best man Julian, was over for a visit in the Netherlands with his to-be wife (Jana), Mario urged them to stay longer at a party to steal a kiss from Mieke. It took until 5:00 in the morning, but that dancing and talking night, marked the beginning of many more to come.

Exploring Nature
Years In Between
In the years Mieke and Mario were blessed to have together already, they like to take an explorer mindset. In the spirit of Sir David Attenborough, you might find these love-birds exploring nature by the usual means of transport or more exotic ones like sailboat, hiking, or kayaking. The two latest active outdoor holiday additions in the pack are kite surfing and wintersport. The magnificence of nature certainly contributed to giving those two souls a special bond.

Finding our Nature Spot
31st July 2020
To this day, it is unclear whether self-interest played a role in the events which unfold, when Jolanda, Mieke's Mom, send a link about buying a Tiny House within 15 minutes walking distance of her own domicile. After rounds of interviews from the Tiny House community - a.k.a. Kluit, Mieke and Mario were enourmously grateful, that they would have the priviledge to buy and live in a Tiny House of the community. Who knows, maybe bringing some German bread, as a little thank you present in the last interview round, terned the tides into their favour?

Fast Forward to Proposing
30th October 2021
While we both always built on our relationship and love for each other, we did not know for quite a while whether we wanted an official married couple status. After a late night proposal from Mieke, which we postponed due to tibsyness üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ü•µ for another moment, Mario waited a few weeks, months, years for a repetition. When one day he was running a half marathon for himself and thought, "If I would die tomorrow, what would I like to do today, which I can actually do today?". That's when he picked some flowers from the side of the road, prepared a little make shift ring, and proposed to Mieke on the spot (completely sweaty) when he came home <3

Municipal Wedding
2nd May 2023
Both Mieke and Mario have the tendency to decide for the unkown, the new, the not-so-smooth path contradicting public perceived standard approaches. Their love for them is not a ceremony which is to be accredited by an unkown person. So, they decided to have the municipal wedding with a very small circle, and have the real-deal wedding, with ceremony, vows, party, dance, and all of you at a later moment.

LoveDay
19th August 2023
Who knows what all will happen this day? What we all know for sure, is that Mieke and Mario are looking forward to sharing this day with you in celebration!
